For example, still included in broadcast songs are such lyrics as \"I sing one song, giving it to Chairman Hua\", \"Chairman Hua leads us in a continual revolution\", \"Closely to Chairman Hua, grasping policy, leading the country and protecting the mountains and rivers\", \"Chairman Hua has come to take the rudder\", etc. In introducing the qualities of a singer, some say she sings several songs lauding older revolutionaries filled with warmth, among them mentioning \"Jiaochengshan\" and \"Chairman Hua has come to participate in the meeting of heads of family\". In broadcasts of documentaries on August 1st, there were images of walls on which were hung pictures of the Chairman side by side with clocks with Comrade Hua Guofeng's portrait. These phenomena all generate very bad political influences among listeners and viewers."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"After the above occurrences, relevant broadcasting departments, local Party committees, and propaganda departments took great notice, undertaking to have concerned radio and TV stations conduct inspections and sum up lessons from their own experience, also taking measures to eliminate the occurrence of this kind of phenomena."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In order to learn from this situation, we hope that propaganda departments in all areas will strengthen the leadership of radio and TV stations, and take practical and effective steps to avoid similar errors being repeated in the future. One must thoroughly inspect and sort out past reels and videotapes, comprehensively ending the transmission and screening of that which is not compatible with the spirit of the Central Committee. Any re-broadcasting and re-transmitting of old reels and vidoetapes, as well as old films, documentaries and educational science films, must be preceded by oral and visual evaluation; leaderships must strictly administer the process. We must further strengthen political thought work, raise the sense of political responsibility of cadres and editorial personnel, strictly and systematically implementing all forms of broadcast programming regulations."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"(Issue 52, September 22)"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Michael Schoenhals"}]}
